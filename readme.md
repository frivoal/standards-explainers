# Salesforce Standards Explainers

Welcome to the Salesforce Standards Explainers. The goal of this repo is to bring our proposed solutions under one roof for ease of discoverability 
proposal/review by the standards body. As the explainers make progress and a decision is made for the proposal they will be archived with a denotation 
of their new location. We will also update the explainer to point to the new location to ensure that no one is referencing out-dated material.
